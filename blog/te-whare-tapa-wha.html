    <h1>Te Whare Tapa Whā</h1>
    <p>
        Te Whare Tapa Whā is a model of the 4 dimensions of wellbeing, developed my Tā Mason 
        Durie in 1984 to provide a Māori perspective on health. Using Te Whare Tapa Whā as a basis,
        I have created myself a personal wellbeing plan. Read more about Te Whare Tapa Whā <a href="https://mentalhealth.org.nz/te-whare-tapa-wha">here.</a>

    <h3>Taha Whanau</h3>
    <p>
      To help improve my familial and social wellbeing, I am making an active effort to join in with as many social
      activities as I can schedule. I am also making sure to reach out to my whanau when I haven't seen or heard from 
      them in a while, to touch base.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Taha Tinana
    </h3>
    <p>
      To maintain my physical health, I am doing my best to minimise the amount of unhealthy food I eat. I am also making 
      it a key part of my week to get at least three good exercise sessions done. Ideally, I would be exercising in a 
      group setting (group bike ride, group run, yoga, rock climbing session) to facilitate maintaining my Taha Whanau.
    </p>
    <h3>Taha Wairua</h3>
    <p>
      Currently, my spiritual journey is involving regular yoga sessions at a club with a lean towards spirituality.
      It has been a great learning experience and I am finding myself more and more open to spirituality and spiritual 
      activities. I have not yet managed to implement a regular meditation routine but I am still aiming to do so.
    </p>
    <h3>Taha Hinengaro</h3>
    <p>
      To maintain a strong mental and emotional state, I am using the three other main walls to hold up my house. By making 
      sure that my Whanau is happy and healthy, I can rely on them to support me when times are tough. By managing my Taha 
      Tinana, my body is able to function well and I can use it to achieve my tasks. By working on my Taha Wairua, I am able 
      to feel more of a sense of fulfillment in myself. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I am currently dealing with some personal issues which make it difficult to have a really strong Taha Hinengaro. 
      The other walls of my Te Whare Tapa Wha are strong however, as the waves of mental and emotional pain come through,
      I am able to work through them and recover to continue my day.
