      <h3>First of all, what are Classes/ID's?</h3>
      <p>
        Classes and ID's are two awesome features of CSS. Instead of having to manually style each and every HTML element,
        classes allow us to abstract out the styling of a feature and reuse it throughout the project. ID's on the other hand,
        also allow us to abstract out the styling of a feature in a project. Generally, best practice is to use classes for elements
        that will appear multiple times throughout a webpage and ID's should be used only for one element. Some key reasons for that 
        are as follows: 
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>ID's can be adjusted via JavaScript</li>
        <li>ID's have a higher priority in the DOM than classes.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Why do these matter?</h3>
      <p>If we choose to add JavaScript functionality to our element, having it appear multiple times throughout a webpage cause issues
        with the functionality of it and just causes unnecessary headache.</p>
      <p>Since ID's have a higher priority than classes, it is better to use classes for the general case. When wanting to control a 
        specific element, we can then use ID's to override any pre-set conditions from the class.</p>
      <h3>How to Implement a class in CSS</h3>
      <p>So, with that out of the way, how do we implement our class in CSS?</p>
      <p>First, we add a class entry into the CSS file, with the associated element properties that we want.
        We signify that it's a class by prepending the entry with a '.' symbol.  </p>

        <p>ID's are used in CSS to define the behaviour of a specific, individual element. They can also be used with Javascript. Like classes, you are <b>able</b> to 
        use them for multiple different elements across a webpage. However, best practice is to only use IDs for things that appear once on the webpage.</p>
        <p>ID's also have a higher priority in the CSS heirarchy. This means that for elements which use both a class and an ID, they will appear as intended when the ID is being used for the specific element.</p>
