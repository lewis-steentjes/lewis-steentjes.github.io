      <h3 class="blog-title">What are the best practices associated with using Classes vs ID's?</h3>
      <p>Classes are used in CSS to define the behaviour of a specified element (or multiple elements). They can be reused over and over again to simplify your HTML code.
        </p>
        <p>ID's are used in CSS to define the behaviour of a specific, individual element. They can also be used with Javascript. Like classes, you are <b>able</b> to 
        use them for multiple different elements across a webpage. However, best practice is to only use IDs for things that appear once on the webpage.</p>
        <p>ID's also have a higher priority in the CSS heirarchy. This means that for elements which use both a class and an ID, they will appear as intended when the ID is being used for the specific element.</p>
