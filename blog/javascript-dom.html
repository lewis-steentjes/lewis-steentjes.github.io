    <h1>JavaScript, the DOM and How "It All Comes Together"</h1>
    <p>When you're building a website, the first things you need to understand are
        HTML and CSS. Together, these tools allow you to build a "static" website, 
        a great way to display information to others. By adding JavaScript into a 
        website, we're able to add "smart" logic to it.
    </p>
    <p> If we were to use the analogy of a car, the HTML would be the layout of 
        the car, the CSS would be the styling and colour scheme and JavaScript 
        would add functionality to it. Where CSS and HTML are read by the browser,
        then displayed to your screen - JavaScript is instead actually running code.
        From there, JavaScript is able to interact with what we call the DOM (Document 
        Object Model) and modify stuff in more complicated ways.
    </p>
    <h3>What's the DOM?</h3>
    <p>The DOM (short for Document Object Model) is what the web browser creates after 
        reading in all of the files for a website. This is hosted locally on the user's
        machine and can be directly manipulated with JavaScript "scripts", which are 
        written in as part of the website.
    </p>
    <h3>What's so special about JavaScript?</h3>
