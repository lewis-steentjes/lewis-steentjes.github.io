        <h1>Neuroplasticity & The Growth Mindset</h1>
        <h3>Neuroplasticity</h3>
        <p>
            Neuroplasticity is the brain's ability to form new pathways and make new connections, especially in response 
            to studying, experiencing something or injury. Have you ever thought of the phrase <i>"people change over time"?</i>
            Neuroplasticity is the key reason why. Neuroplasticity can cause people to become bitter and sour over time, if 
            they continually go through struggles. Neuroplasticity can also cause people to become smarter, more sociable 
            and better at physical tasks. By understanding the underlying principals of neuroplasticity, we can train our 
            brains to work for us, rather than against us and achieve our goals.
        </p>
        <p>
            According to the <a href="https://www.neuroskills.com/brain-injury/neuroplasticity/ten-principles-of-neuroplasticity/">Centre For Neuro Skills,</a>
            there are 10 key principals that can be helpful to keep in mind when thinking about neuroplasticity from a 
            treatment perspective for people who have undergone brain injury. 
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Use It or Lose It</li>
            <li>Use It and Improve It</li>
            <li>Specificity</li>
            <li>Repetition Matters</li>
            <li>Intensity Matters</li>
            <li>Time Matters</li>
            <li>Salience Matters</li>
            <li>Age Matters</li>
            <li>Transference or Generalization</li>
            <li>Interference</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Taking the key points of "Use It or Lose It", "Use It and Improve It", "Repetition Matters" and "Intensity Matters" 
            (full explanation, see <a href="https://www.neuroskills.com/brain-injury/neuroplasticity/ten-principles-of-neuroplasticity/">source</a>)
            we can construct our learning plan to incorporate these points. 
            We want to be keeping our pathways that we have built active by making sure to use them. If we put the effort into learning something,
            we need to upkeep the skill by occassionally going back to it. We should know that by using a neural pathway, we can improve it. 
            By trying new things and seeing what did and didn't work, our brains are capable of rewiring pathways to work better than before. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Induction of plasticity requires sufficient repition. If you're a 
            rock climber, you will understand that well. Rock climbers see a challenge and attempt it, when they fail they try again. It's the repeated 
            attempts of trying the climb again and again that train the brain to make the correct motor functions to allow the climber to traverse a route.
            It can take <i><b>a lot</b></i> of attempts to succeed on a route but after it's been climbed once, repeated attempts will continue to make 
            it easier and easier.
        </p>
        <p>
            Induction of plasticity requires sufficient intensity. For building new neuropathways, and improving others - it's important to be 
            performing a task of sufficient intensity. If the brain is not being actively engaged in the task, it is difficult for it to form new pathways.

        <h3>The Growth Mindset</h3>
        <p>
            People who have a growth mindset believe that they are capable of growing and improving upon themselves. People who believe that they are 
            unable to change, that their abilities are set in stone have a fixed mindset. It's important to have a growth mindset when you're trying 
            to learn something new. When you come across something that pushes you out of your comfort zone, you need to be able to push through that 
            and understand that with practice and repetition, it will get easier.
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="https://hbr.org/2016/01/what-having-a-growth-mindset-actually-means">This article</a> goes over some misconceptions about the growth
            mindset. It makes an interesting point that the growth mindset is not just about "praising and rewarding effort". It's important to be able to 
            differentiate between success and failure when trying to utilise the growth mindset, as although growth is possible - it's not guaranteed. You 
            need to have a solid plan for growth that both makes sense, and is achievable. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Another interesting part of the aforementioned <a href="https://hbr.org/2016/01/what-having-a-growth-mindset-actually-means">article</a> is
            that companies themselves can have growth and fixed mindsets. When thinking back to personal relationships I have had with other companies 
            and people, I find that I prefer the company of those with growth mindsets. I have also enjoyed working at companies with growth mindsets more 
            so than companies with fixed mindsets. This is something that I want to monitor in my own life before I make any decisions about how I feel regarding
            entities with fixed mindsets.

        <h3>My Learning Plan</h3>
        <p>
            After conducting this research, I want to add a reviewal process to me learning plan to incorporate the "Use It or Lose It" principal. For Bootcamp,
            we will be learning a lot of material very quickly. There won't be a lot of time for repetition so I will need a way to ensure that I retain as 
            much information as possible. I will use my learning journal as a way of recording different topics that I have learnt about, then during weekly review 
            I will go over my journal to see what topics were learnt across the whole course. If any start to feel particularly vague, I will need to schedule a time 
            to go back over the concepts, or use the involved tools.
