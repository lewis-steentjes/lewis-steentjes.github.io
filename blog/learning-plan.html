        <h1>My Learning Plan</h1>
        <h3>What is your long term goal and career pathway?</h3>
        <p>I want to get through Dev Academy by making some cool projects for my portfolio. From there, 
            the goal is to utilise my previously learned skills to apply for a wide variety of dev roles 
            - from embedded work to web dev.</p>
        <h3>A description of your strength and weaknesses when it comes to learning:</h3>
        <h4>Strengths:</h4>
        <p>I’m good at working when I have tight time pressure constraints. I also excel when it comes to 
            picking up new technologies and trying to understand the deeper workings of things. </p>
        <h4>Weaknesses:</h4>
        <p>I struggle when I have too much freedom and don’t have enough pressure to prevent myself from 
            procrastinating and getting distracted. I also struggle when I find topics boring/repetitive 
            or when something isn’t quite making enough sense. I also have low self-esteem, and 
            frequently talk myself down.</p>
        <h3>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
        <p>I want to get better at self-management!</p>
        <p>This means making better plans, sticking to those plans, reflecting on how well I have done and logging it.</p>
        <p>I also want to better understand how others percieve me and build on that. Along with that, I want
            to develop my personal image a bit more and learn to communicate that. </p>
        <p>Improving my openness is another thing I am working on. Being more open to other people's ways
            of doing things, and trying everything out whole-heartedly is a big aim for me here. If you're feeling 
            similarly at the moment, I suggest you try out this <a href="https://youtu.be/KkurfEQrg94">pranayama technique</a>.
        </p>
        <h3>4. A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme: </h3>
        <p>I will work productively with other learners by trying to help out people where I can. 
            I will actively participate in group discussion and activities.
            I will maintain a professional standard with my work. 
            I will show people that I care by making cool things.
            I will actively maintain my health, through proper sleep management and exercise.
            I will actively maintain my social connections, by participating in activities with my friends
            outside of the course.</p>
        <h3>5. A commitment to how and where you will seek help in a timely way:</h3>
        <p>When I am feeling down, I will ask my close friends to visit. If I am feeling really stuck
            with a part of the course, I will post on Discord to ask for help. If I feel like I am unable
        to complete the requires tasks on time, I will reach out to my home group facilitator.</p>
        <h3>6. A description of what you expect from the facilitation team:</h3>
        <p>The facilitation team will help us by make sure we're sticking to the allocated schedule,
            helping to solve problems as they arise and give us useful feedback based on our work.
            They will also help by organising group-based activities and provide positive encouragement
            when we need the help.</p>
        <h3>7. Any scheduling information such as block-out times:</h3>
        <p>I will be blocking out sections of time in the evening to attend group yoga classes and 
            rock climbing group sessions. I haven't quite sorted out my schedule just yet, but I plan
            on incorporating a midday exercise session as well.
