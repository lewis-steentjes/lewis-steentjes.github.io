    <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
    <p>Emotional intelligence, as opposed to intellectual intelligence, is the ability to understand, use and 
        manage your emotions. EQ is commonly defined by four main attributes:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Self-Management</li>
    <li>Self-Awareness</li>
    <li>Social Awareness</li>
    <li>Relationship Management</li></ol>
    <h3>How is EQ different to IQ?</h3>
    <p>Where IQ is measured by the ability to interpret and solving logical problems, EQ is about interpreting
        and solving emotional problems. There are also <a href="https://enterprisersproject.com/article/2019/6/can-emotional-intelligence-be-learned-4-techniques">
        claims</a> that EQ can be learned and improved upon, whereas IQ is considered to be mostly static.</p>
    <h3>Why is EQ Important?</h3>
    <p>Being able to understand, manage and control your emotions is important for being able to follow through
        with your plans. Your emotional state can have a big impact on your ability to perform. If you are 
        aware of your emotional state, you can more accurately assess a situation, by being able to take into 
        account your own emotional bias.
    </p>
    <p> Aside from understanding, managing and controlling your own emotions, EQ is important for being able to
        consider <i>other</i> people's emotions. Being able to consider both yours, and others emotions is 
        great for handling situations when you're not "on the same page" as someone else. The reason <i>why</i> 
        someone else might not agree with you could be from a variety of factors - uncommon assumptions, difference
        in background, difference in ethics or a difference in stage of life - just to name a few. EQ helps to 
        identify potential problems that lie outside of the scope of hard logic and reasoning.
